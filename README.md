# Neurogene Portal Frontend

Neurogene is a web-based frontend interface built with Next.js and styled using shadcn/ui. It allows users to explore how gene expression changes throughout human brain development, powered by data from the BrainVar project.

This frontend is designed to interact with a Django-based backend API, which generates LOESS-smoothed gene expression plots as downloadable PDFs.

üöÄ Features
üîé Gene Search Interface
Enter a gene symbol (e.g., SCN2A, SYNGAP1) to explore expression trends.

üìâ Smooth PDF Plot Download
Visualizations are served as downloadable PDF files via the API.

üé® Modern UI
Built with shadcn/ui, offering a responsive, clean, and accessible interface.

üåê Fast & SEO-Friendly
Leveraging the power of Next.js for fast, server-rendered React apps.
